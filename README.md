# Book_Finder

## Project Overview

The **Book Search Engine** is a web application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. This project involves refactoring an existing RESTful API implementation to use GraphQL with Apollo Server. The application is built using the MERN stack and enables users to save book searches to the backend.

## Features

- **GraphQL API with Apollo Server**: Replaces the previous RESTful API for efficient data querying.
- **Book Search**: Users can search for books by title, author, or genre using the Google Books API.
- **User Authentication**: Secure authentication middleware integrated into GraphQL.
- **Save Books**: Users can save books to their account for future reference.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with React for a seamless and modern user experience.
- **MongoDB Database**: Stores user information and saved books via MongoDB Atlas.
